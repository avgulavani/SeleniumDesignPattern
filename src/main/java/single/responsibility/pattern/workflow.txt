1. Launch google
2. enter the given keyword on the main page
3. click on the N'suggestion
4. enter the given keyword on the google result page
5. click on the N'th suggestion again
6. go to the news/video/image
7. print the search result

Summary-

1. Create component for as class
	for example if google main page - search and suggestion widgets are the component and google main page is page object
2. Class should have a very clear purpose

3. Cohesion- all related class kept together also in same package including page object for those classes.

4. Package Structure	
	4.1 Create multiple component (search widget) and include reference in page object class(GoogleMain)
	4.2 ideally new requirement should be convered into new class
	4.3 clean test classes
	
5. is my class following SRP pattern? General guideline-
	5.1 KISS principle (Keep it simple stupid)
	5.2 max 100 lines in class

# Highly cohesive - classes and component with relatively same feature in one package.
# Loosely coupled - class from package A and another class from package 2
